# Amazon-Customer-Data-Analysis
In this project I performed data analysis on Amazon reviews dataset, extracted from database.sqlite. Cleaned and transformed data, including datatype conversions. Analyzed top users' product preferences, identified highly reviewed products, compared behavior of frequent and non-frequent viewers, and found frequent viewers to be more verbose. Conducted sentiment analysis, identifying top keywords for positive and negative reviews.I have tried to document insights obtained form this project by writing a medium article .
